# Kattis UI Fix

This is the repository for the extension Kattis UI Fix, the extension that adds back in the "My Submissions" and "Statistics" buttons to Kattis problem pages.
Additionally, the extension adds a toggle to view/hide the code editor panel so you can view the problem description in it's entirety.
